# Responsive Cards

Demonstration project illustrating how to use Bootstrap cards with columns to create responsive cards.

A common issue when creating responsive web pages is how to display images 
with different aspect ratios.  Here the images are wrapped in a div 
with a fixed aspect ratio, and the images use the object-fit property to 
ensure the images cover the entire div.
