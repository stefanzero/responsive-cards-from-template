Tigers are habitat generalists, and have adapted to diverse habitats inclusive of equatorial rainforests and mangroves in India and Sumatra, semi-arid habitats of western India, Himalayan deciduous and evergreen forests up to elevations of about 4,500 m and temperate forests in northeast Russia and China."

          "p": "Hunting of tigers and their prey has been the main driver of Tiger population declines. Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat, and tonics, is a primary threat to tigers, which, along with prey depletion, has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat and continues at sustainable rates."

As elephant habitats decrease and get more fragmented, the interaction between humans and elephants increase, leading to intense conflicts between people and elephants, causing fatalities on both sides besides damage to human property."

This species is one of the rarest in the world."

Their ecology is defined by their role as apex predators in a harsh environment, hunting prey like musk oxen, arctic hares, and caribou.

Climate change impacts their prey like musk oxen and Arctic hares, while industrial activities such as mining, roads, and pipelines encroach on their territory. Unlike other wolves, they are not threatened by human hunting due to their remote habitat."

Their habitat is defined by their need for land for nesting and sea for feeding, particularly in areas with productive upwelling zones, such as the Galapagos Islands, the Gulf of California, and the coast of Peru. Their ecology includes spectacular plunge-diving for prey, a unique foot-lifting courtship dance, and ground nests often marked with guano. "

While they have few predators, their population has significantly declined in recent years, particularly in the Galapagos, due to these environmental pressures."
