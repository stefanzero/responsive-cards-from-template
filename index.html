                Extant Tiger subpopulations occur in the tropical, subtropical
                and temperate forests of South and Southeast Asia and the
                temperate evergreen forests of Palaearctic realms in Russia and
                China. Tigers are habitat generalists, and have adapted to
                diverse habitats inclusive of equatorial rainforests and
                mangroves in India and Sumatra, semi-arid habitats of western
                India, Himalayan deciduous and evergreen forests up to
                elevations of about 4,500 m and temperate forests in northeast
                Russia and China.

              <p>
                Hunting of Tigers and their prey has been the main driver of
                Tiger population declines. Poaching for illegal trade in
                high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat, and
                tonics, is a primary threat to Tigers, which, along with prey
                depletion, has led to their recent disappearance from broad
                areas of otherwise suitable habitat and continues at
                unsustainable rates.

                Worldwide polar bear numbers are estimated to be around 23,000

                Polar bears inhabit the circumpolar Arctic and portions of the
                subarctic on sea-ice and along coastal areas and islands.
                Although they sometimes range into international waters, polar
                bears generally occur in areas under the jurisdiction of five
                countries: Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Norway, Russia, and the
                United States (Alaska).

              <p>
                Polar bears face numerous threats, with climate change and its
                impact on sea ice being the most significant. Other major
                threats include human-caused mortality, mineral and energy
                resource exploration and development, contaminants, shipping,
                tourism, and diseases.

                As of 2018, population size estimates collated across all range
                countries, suggest a global Asian Elephant abundance of
                48,323–51,680 individuals in the wild.

                Asian Elephants inhabit grassland, tropical evergreen forest,
                semi-evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous
                forested and dry thorn forest, in addition to cultivated and
                secondary forests or scrublands. They are seen from sea level to
                over 3,000 m asl in the Eastern Himalaya (Choudhury 1999).

                The challenges confronting elephant conservation in most
                elephant Range States are habitat loss and fragmentation,
                human–elephant conflict, and poaching and illegal trade of
                elephants. As elephant habitats decrease and get more
                fragmented, the interaction between humans and elephants
                increase, leading to intense conflicts between people and
                elephants, causing fatalities on both sides besides damage to
                human property.

                The global population was estimated to number 312-455
                individuals.

                The blue-throated macaw lives in the Llano de Moxos of the Beni
                Department of Bolivia, nesting in "Islas" (islands) of palm
                trees that dot the level plains. This ecosystem is characterized
                by a mix of grasslands, marshes, forest islands, and gallery
                forests along waterways. It is not a forest-dwelling bird. This
                species is one of the rarest in the world.

            <section class="threats">
              <h3 class="text-center">Threats</h3>
              <p>
                The species was severely threatened in the past by legal and
                illegal exploitation for the national and international
                cage-bird trade. There are fears that inbreeding within an
                increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced
                fertility.
